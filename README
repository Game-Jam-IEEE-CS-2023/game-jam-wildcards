"Wa-ha-ha-haha!! It is with this very hands that I, Vermius the Wizard, have seized the realm of truth
and have ascended beyond this uni-dimensional clutter of circuits and microprocessors!!! Do you want to stop me?!
Come and beat me in the domain in which I was born, the heart of the cards!!!"

Welcome to WildCards! A thrilling and exciting game in which you will play with a bunch of cool
(but sadly without visual art) cards and defeat Vermius, the wizard that was born due to me not knowing
how to use pointers and handle memory leaks when using classes in C++! H-Hahah... Well, that aside! Go, you
must stop Vermius before he destroys my computer, do you think you are up to the task? I trust in you, good luck!

Here are the rules for the game:

### Rules

- First, you will have a hand of 5 cards dealt at the beginning of the first round. As the game goes by, you will draw a card
at the beginning of each turn!
- To win and defeat Vermius so you can free my computer? Reduce his Prime Points to 0! (PP for abbreviation, it's the HP unit of the game!)
- But be careful tho! If you have YOUR Prime Points (or PP) reduced to 0, we lose and my computer is a goner!
- You both start with 20! Be sure to quickly seize victory.
- To deal damage to Vermius, first you have to place a card and pay its energy cost (which will appear listed at the top of each card right below its name.)
Then, you can command it to attack once you finish placing cards. Be aware that declaring your attack will end the turn!
- Be careful tho! Watch out for the ATK and DEF stat of each card on the field, they will determine the outcome of each battle!
- If your card's attack stat (ATK) is lower than the defense (DEF) of Vermius's defending card. Then he will easily deflect the offensive!
- Moreover, if the defending card's attack is higher than your attacking card's defense, then your card will be eliminated! Watch out and play smart!
- If two cards are tied for the condition of each one being destroyed, then both are destroyed.
- You start with 8 energy, and it will refresh by the beginning of your turn, so don't worry! Just get to dueling!
- Here is a tip: Despite Vermius being quite intimidating, his cards have very low Defense. So be on the lookout for that! ^w^
- Cards also have types! But do not worry, they do not affect gameplay (yet...)

Thank you, now you are ready and set to play. Begin the main.cpp file in this folder. Into the fray soldier!!!
